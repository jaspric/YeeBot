# YeeBot
## A bot made with discord.py and love

Everything is slowly being moved into the rewrite. Once complete, that will become the root directory.

### TODO:
There is a [Trello Project](https://trello.com/b/70M7ljxB/yeebot) tracking the progress of YeeBot.

### Getting Started:
* Clone YeeBot
* PIP requirements:

  * discord.py
  * matplotlib
  * praw
  * numpy
  
* System Requirements:
  * python 3.5 or greater
  
* Create a 'secrets.py' file in the root directory of yeebot with the following information:
```python
    BOT_TOKEN = '<bot_token here>'
    CLIENT_ID = '<discord client id here>'
    CLIENT_SECRET = '<discord client secret here>'
    
    REDDIT_TOKEN = '<reddit token here>'
    REDDIT_CLIENT_ID = '<reddit client id here>'
    USER_AGENT = '<reddit user agent here>'
    
    REVIEW_CHANNEL_ID = '<channel id for the discord channel you want to dedicate meme reviews to>'
```
